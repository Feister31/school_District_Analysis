# School_District_Analysis
### Overview of the School district Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to under state that level of competeancy of reading and math is within the 15 school districts. The relationship of budget to students , the size of the school, and school types. To understand how each of these key factors plays a role in the success of the students in the schools I had to first understand the relationships on a more macro level.
### Results
  * The District Summary stated that between the 15 schools, the total budget was over $25 million dollars and an overall passing percentage of 65.2% for math and reading. With a total of 39,170 students, that means more than 12,000 are no passing the expected math and english proficiency.
  * School Summary shows that regardless of the size and type of school. Majority of the schools regardless of the size and school type have relatively the same dedicated to a student.
  * Replacing the 9th grade math and reading score did not affect the relative performance of the schools as much. Average Math Score dropped by 0.1, reading scores doesnt change and the % of Math passing dropped by 1.1. But it has no affects on the school size or types.
### Summary
